## Cloud & DevOps Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio project, built to showcase my skills and practical experience as a **Cloud and DevOps Engineer working with AWS**. The portfolio highlights real-world cloud concepts, infrastructure practices, and modern frontend design, presented through a clean and professional interface.

The project focuses on how cloud systems are designed, automated, and scaled, rather than just how they look. AI-assisted tools were used to enhance design quality, content clarity, and overall user experience, while core engineering decisions were implemented manually to reflect hands-on learning.
